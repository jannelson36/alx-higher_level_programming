# Higher-level programming - Python, Databases & JavaScript

This repository contains programs written for the higher-level programming
track at ALX School. In these projects, which began occurring in month
four of the year one curriculum, I am learning about Python, MySQL and JavaScript.
Simultaneously, I continued to reinforce and expand my skills in C and shell
scripting. The specific list of projects contained follows:

* [0x00. Python - Hello, World](./0x00-python-hello_world)
* [0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions](./0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions)
* [0x02. Python - import & modules](./0x02-python-import_modules)
* [0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples](./0x03-python-data_structures)
* [0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary](./0x04-python-more_data_structures)
* [0x05. Python - Exceptions](./0x05-python-exceptions)
